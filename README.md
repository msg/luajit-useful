# luajit useful library

This library has been created from years of development of applications
to simplify and speed the process.  It also includes a couple of utilities
from 3rd party developers.

It is also designed to be embedded into projects so they can become self-
contained.

It uses the *luajit posix library* which is an api that is a luajit ffi
interface to posix interfaces.  It also includes linux apis that aren't
necessarily posix compliant.  This library may change it's name as it
is not truly posix compliant.
